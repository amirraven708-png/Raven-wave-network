**Invisible. Untraceable. Unstoppable.**

Raven is an open-source, decentralized radio mesh protocol designed for censorship-resistant communication and internet access. It combines ultra-low-detectability stealth techniques with chaotic dynamics, post-quantum cryptography, and self-organizing synchronization to create a network that is virtually undetectable by spectrum analyzers, machine-learning-based detectors, or triangulation systems.

Ideal for environments with heavy internet censorship, surveillance, or infrastructure disruption.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Near-Zero Detectability**  
  Blue Silence Weight (BSW) + Adaptive ML Mimicry → signals blend into environmental noise  
  Measured Stealth Index: **0.022** (effectively invisible)

- **Frequency Agility**  
  Pseudorandom Frequency Hopping (LFSR-based) across 64+ channels

- **Collision-Free Synchronization**  
  Wave Consensus using Kuramoto oscillator model (Order Parameter > 0.99)

- **Secure Chaotic Routing**  
  Duffing Oscillator phase-based routing — unextractable without phase key

- **Anti-Triangulation**  
  Dynamic phantom sources with Gaussian noise for location deception

- **Post-Quantum Security**  
  CRYSTALS-Kyber key exchange + ChaCha20-Poly1305 symmetric encryption

- **Hybrid Multi-Layer Architecture**  
  - Backbone: TV White Spaces (470–790 MHz) — long range, deep penetration  
  - Distribution: LoRa Mesh (433 MHz ISM) — medium range, low power  
  - Access: Wi-Fi Mesh (2.4 GHz) — high throughput, local coverage

- **Self-Organizing & Energy Efficient**  
  Gossip-based propagation, adaptive sleep cycles, no central coordinator

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements (Minimal PoC)
- 2× ESP32 development boards
- 2× LoRa modules (e.g., SX1276/78 or E22/E32)
- Optional: RTL-SDR for testing stealth
- Optional: TVWS-capable SDR for backbone layer

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.10+ (simulation & prototyping)
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (ESP32 firmware)
- Libraries: LoRa, Crypto (pqm4/liboqs for Kyber), BLE

### Quick Start (Simulation)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raven-project.git
cd raven-project

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run stealth simulation
python simulate/invisible_eagle.py
```

### Deploy on ESP32 (Basic Node)
1. Flash firmware from `/firmware/esp32_lora_stealth`
2. Configure node ID and initial seed via serial
3. Nodes will auto-discover and sync via Wave Consensus
